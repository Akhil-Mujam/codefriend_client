CodeFriend - An Blog and Chat Platform for coders

url:https://codefriendtest.netlify.app/

Developed a project where the developers and Tech related-guys can write blogs on new technologies and can answer the questions of other developers. There is also an option for open chat where the developers express their views on trending topics. Used (MERN Stack for the Project and socket.io for the chat platform). I dealt with both the backend and frontend parts.
